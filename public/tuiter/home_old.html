           <p> Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing,
            and inferring information—demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence
            displayed by non-human animals and humans. Example tasks in which this is done
            include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages,
            as well as other mappings of inputs.</p>

            <p> Artificial intelligence is here, and it’s coming for your job.
                So promising are the tool’s capabilities that Microsoft — amid laying off
                10,000 people — has announced a “multiyear, multibillion-dollar investment”
                in the revolutionary technology, which is growing smarter by the day.
                And the rise of machines leaves many well-paid workers vulnerable, experts warn.</p>
